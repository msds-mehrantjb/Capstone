## Agent-Based Risk Analysis and Assessment on Windows-Based Machines Using ISO 27001 {.scrollable}

- Enterprise networks face rapidly evolving cyber threats and constant configuration changes
- Traditional assessments (manual audits + scheduled scans) are too slow and expensive
- This project delivers **continuous, automated, Windows-focused risk assessment**
- Built for **deep visibility + low overhead** using native Windows APIs and PowerShell
- Produces actionable findings aligned with **security best practices** and **ISO 27001 controls**

---

## Problem Statement (Why This Matters) {.scrollable}

Organizations struggle to maintain real-time security visibility in enterprise environments.

**Limitations of traditional approaches:**
- Periodic/manual audits → **delayed detection**
- Scheduled vulnerability scans → **long scan durations** and disruptive traffic
- High operational cost + reliance on specialized expertise
- Dynamic Windows environments (services, patching, firewall rules) change constantly

**Result:** Security posture becomes outdated quickly, increasing exposure and compliance risk.

## Commercial Vulnerability Scanners in the Market {.scrollable}

Commercial platforms such as **Nessus, Qualys, and Rapid7 Nexpose/InsightVM** are widely used for enterprise vulnerability management.

- **Nessus (Tenable)**: broad coverage via plugins; licensing cost and overhead can be high
- **Qualys VM**: cloud-based with sensors; may raise internet dependency and data sovereignty concerns
- **Rapid7 Nexpose/InsightVM**: strong enterprise workflows; often requires significant deployment and tuning

**Common limitations:**
- Expensive licensing for many organizations
- Scans can be time-consuming (45–90 minutes) and generate heavy network traffic
- Outputs may still require expert interpretation and manual remediation planning

**Gap addressed:**  
A lightweight, Windows-optimized approach enhanced with **agent automation + LLM reasoning** for usability, prioritization, and remediation guidance.

---

## Motivation & Context (Windows Enterprise Reality) {.scrollable}

Windows dominates corporate infrastructure and introduces unique security challenges.

- Windows systems represent ~**76% of enterprise desktop deployments globally**
- Large service ecosystem → increased attack surface
- Complex firewall configurations → frequent misconfigurations
- Continuous patch management requirements → compliance gaps
- Dynamic environments (new services, role changes, endpoint diversity) require **continuous monitoring**

**Need:** A lightweight approach optimized for **Windows enterprise environments**.

## Proposed Solution: Agent-Based Risk Assessment Platform {.scrollable}

An **agent-based security assessment platform** optimized for Windows enterprise environments.

**Core idea:**  
Multiple specialized agents continuously collect evidence, analyze risk, map findings to ISO 27001, and generate actionable guidance.

**Platform capabilities:**
- Deep Windows visibility using **native Windows APIs + PowerShell integration**
- Multi-layer assessment:
  - Port exposure and network surface
  - Service identification and configuration review
  - Firewall policy analysis
  - Patch and update compliance validation
- **LLM-assisted reasoning** for interpretation, prioritization, and reporting
- **Conversational UI (LLM-driven assistant)** for accessibility and non-expert use

## Key Contributions (Agent + LLM Enabled) {.scrollable}

1. **Hybrid scanning strategy for enterprise safety**
   - Combines passive evidence (listening ports) with targeted probing  
   - Improves coverage while reducing disruption

2. **Multi-dimensional risk assessment framework**
   - Evaluates risk across **service exposure**, **configuration security**, and **patch compliance**

3. **Intelligent firewall policy analysis**
   - Detects misconfigurations and policy violations  
   - Highlights risky inbound rules, weak profiles, and unnecessary exposure

4. **Agent-based automation for scalability**
   - Dedicated agents handle collection, analysis, correlation, and reporting  
   - Reduces reliance on specialized security expertise

5. **LLM-powered accessibility and remediation guidance**
   - Natural-language explanations of findings  
   - Actionable remediation aligned with best practices and ISO 27001  
   - Conversational interface lowers the barrier for non-specialist admins
