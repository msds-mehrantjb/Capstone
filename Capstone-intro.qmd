## Commercial Vulnerability Scanners in the Market {.scrollable}

- **Nessus (Tenable)**: broad coverage via plugins; licensing cost and overhead can be high<sup>1</sup>
- **Qualys VM**: cloud-based with sensors; may raise internet dependency and data sovereignty concern<sup>2</sup>
- **Rapid7 Nexpose/InsightVM**: strong enterprise workflows; often requires significant deployment and tuning<sup>3</sup>

**Common limitations:** <br/>
- Expensive licensing for many organizations <br/>
- Scans can be time-consuming (45–90 minutes) and generate heavy network traffic <br/>
- Outputs may still require expert interpretation and manual remediation planning <br/>

## Problem Statement (Why This Matters)

- Enterprise networks face rapidly evolving cyber threats and constant configuration changes
- Organizations struggle to maintain real-time security visibility in enterprise environments.
- Traditional assessments (manual audits + scheduled scans) are too slow and expensive

**Result:** Security posture becomes outdated quickly, increasing exposure and compliance risk.

- This project delivers **continuous, automated, Windows-focused risk assessment** <br/>
- Built for **deep visibility + low overhead** using native Windows APIs and PowerShell <br/>
- Produces actionable findings aligned with **security best practices** and **ISO 27001 controls** <br/>

**Gap addressed:** A lightweight, Windows-optimized approach enhanced with **agent automation + LLM reasoning** for usability, prioritization, and remediation guidance.

## Major Steps in Risk Analysis abd Assessment Alignesd with ISO 27001 Standard 
- Establish the Context (Scope & Boundaries)
- Asset Identification & Classification
- Identify Threats & Threat Sources
- Identify Vulnerabilities & Weaknesses
- Identify Existing Controls (Current Security Posture)
- Risk Analysis (Likelihood + Impact)
- Risk Evaluation (Prioritize & Decide)
- Risk Treatment (Choose a Treatment Option)
- Select ISO 27001 Controls (Annex A Mapping)
- Map treatment actions to ISO 27001 Annex A controls
- Implement Controls & Action Plan
- Monitor, Review, and Improve (Continuous Risk Management)


## Proposed Solution: Agent + LLM Enabled Risk Analysis and Assessment Platform
- **Establish the Context (Scope & Boundaries)** 
  - Agentic help:
    - Detects OS type (Windows Server vs Desktop)
    - Discovers domain membership, environment (prod/dev)
    - Identifies installed roles (AD, IIS, SQL, File Server,...)
  - LLM help:
    - Create conversational interface lowers the barrier for non-specialists admins
    - Generates ISO-style scope statements automatically
- **Asset Identification & Classification**
  - Agentic Help:
    - Enumerates software, services, ports, users, data locations
    - Identifies sensitive assets (databases, cert stores, AD,...)
  - LLM help:
    - Classify assets by confidentiality / integrity / availability (CIA) importance

## Proposed Solution: Agent + LLM Enabled Risk Analysis and Assessment Platform (Continued)
- **Identify Threats & Threat Sources**
  - Agent Help
    - Maps detected assets → threat categories
- **Identify Vulnerabilities & Weaknesses**
  - Agent help:
    - Checks patch levels
    - Detects insecure configurations
    - Flags unnecessary services/software
    - Correlates software versions with CVE feeds
- **Identify Existing Controls (Current Security Posture)**
  - Agent help:
    - Detects MFA, EDR, firewall, backups, encryption, ...
    - Validates configuration state (enabled, configured) 
  - LLM help:
    - Maps detected controls to ISO 27001 Annex A
    - Writes justification text automatically

## Proposed Solution: Agent + LLM Enabled Risk Analysis and Assessment Platform (Continued)
- **Risk Analysis (Likelihood + Impact)**
  - Agent help:
    - Calculates likelihood from exposure, exploitability
    - Estimates impact from asset criticality + role
  - LLM help:
    - Converts numeric scores into:
      - Human-explainable reasoning
      - Management-level risk language
- **Risk Evaluation (Prioritize & Decide)**
  - Agent help:
    - Compares risks against acceptance criteria
    - Flags risks requiring treatment
- **Risk Treatment Selection**
  - LLM help:
    - Proposes mitigate/avoid/transfer/accept options via conversational interface
    - Generates ISO-compliant treatment descriptions

## Proposed Solution: Agent + LLM Enabled Risk Analysis and Assessment Platform (Continued)
- **Select ISO 27001 Controls (Annex A Mapping)**
  - Agent help:
    - Auto-selects relevant Annex A controls
    - Tracks applied vs excluded controls
  - LLM help:
    - Writes the Statement of Applicability
- **Implement Controls & Action Plan**
  - Agent help:
    - Validates control implementation status
  - LLM help:
    - Generates:
      - Task descriptions
      - Remediation documentation
      - Policy text drafts
- **Monitor, Review, and Improve (Continuous Risk Management)**
  - Agent help:
    - Watches for config drift, new software, new threats
    - Triggers reassessment automatically
  - LLM help:
    - Summarizes changes into:
      - Management dashboards, or natural language interface instead of dashboards
      - Audit-ready reports

## Typical ISO 27001 Outputs (Final Deliverables) 

**An LLM serves as a smart ISO 27001 assistant that uses data and results captured during the risk analysis and assessment steps to generate the following outputs in predefined formats.** <br/>

- Risk assessment methodology <br/>
- Asset inventory + classification <br/>
- Risk register (scenarios, scores, owners) <br/>
- Risk treatment plan <br/>
- Statement of Applicability (SoA) <br/>
- Evidence of implemented controls and monitoring <br/>
